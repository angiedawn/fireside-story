    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
      An old sea captain by the name of Henry Williams sat on his porch,
      looking out on a roiling sea. He leaned back in his chair and thought back to storm many many years ago.
      It had started out as a seemingly calm day in 1985, and he was working on a merchant vessel in the Mediterranean Sea.
