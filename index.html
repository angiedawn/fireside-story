    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
      An old sea captain by the name of Henry Williams sat on his porch,
      looking out on a roiling sea. He leaned back in his chair and thought back to a storm many many years ago.
      It had started out as a seemingly calm day in 1985, and he was working on a merchant vessel in the Mediterranean Sea.
      The skys were blue the boilers were running full speed and there was no worry in the world. One of the men at the bow of the ship and yelled out "starboard look! atorms a comin! 
      " Henry looked up and was frozen to his very core. he had never seen the likes of the storm brewing in front of him.
